This is a simple project about using Amazon MemoryDB for Redis.
 
Amazon MemoryDB for Redis is a fully managed, Redis-compatible, in-memory database that delivers ultra-fast performance and Multi-AZ durability for modern applications built using microservices architectures. MemoryDB gives you the power to build highly scalable, low-latency applications with microsecond read and single-digit millisecond write performance, while using the existing Redis APIs and tools you already know. MemoryDB is compatible with Redis 5.0.6, enabling you to migrate your highest-performance workloads to the cloud with minimal effort.
